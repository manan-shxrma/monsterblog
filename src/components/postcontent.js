        "Before digging deep into the question, let me first describe the underlying reasons for starting the one-child policy.China introduced the ‚ÄúOne Child policy‚Äù as a part of its Great Leap forward movement to control its skyrocketing population and to ease the pressure on its natural resources. At that time, it was seen as a great strategy to transform the country from an agrarian economy to an industrial giant with the motto of ‚ÄúLater, Longer, and Fewer. But, due to underlying reasons, China had to first ease the one-child policy and eventually remove it by 2015.China is known to provide cheap as well as skilled labor to the world. Its major driving force is its youth. But due to implications of the one-child policy, this youth workforce in China has reached a substantial downfall in its youth workforce. Moreover, due to the initial mishandling of Covid-19 and lack of transparency in its governmental regime, the world is shifting emphasis towards India."
